                        <p>I've been having these ideas a lot in the past weeks.<p>
                        <p>Im going into the virtual world  trying to make friends , but it seems like im failing every time , and im not sure why .</p>
                        <p>and every time , I keep thinking , is something wrong with me ?  what is it ? should I change my self ? </p>
                        <p>those idea keep haunting me most my day , feels like there is no answer for these questions , or maybe I just cant see it , maybe im just blind by something , or im viewing things from the wrong prospective . </p>
                        <p>I've been trying to spend time with my friends that I already made , but it feels like , everyone is avoiding me , and none of my friends join me anymore .</p>
                        <p>only time well tell me what I should do , but also I cant keep waiting for an answer , I need to find it , I have nothing better to do after all .</p>
                        <p>that usually means I have to start from nothing again , " im pretty used to it " I keep telling my self , but every time it happens I die a little in side , and I think its building up quickly .</p>
                        <p>im thinking maybe im not being patient , but most the time it feels like there is no place for me around the people that  try to talk to and make friends with , most the times it feels like people are just pushing me away .</p>
                        <p>or maybe im just not meant for socializing , even though I try , maybe I already had my chances and I wasted them .</p>
                        <p>this reminds me of a story : </p>
                        <p>its about an old wise man , he worshiped god and he was a good man , he always did people around him good and followed god's orders . One day the village he was living in was flooding people started to run out side the village to safety , every one that lived in that village knew the old man , people were passing by him , offering to "pic him up" to safety  to witch he replied "i will be fine , god will save me " , until the last person passed by him and told him "come with me im the last person leaving , if you don't come you wont survive the flood" , he refused and said " god will save me from the flood " . </p>
                        <p>when the flood ended , and the people started to go back to their village , they found the old man dead.</p>
                        <p>and one of the men said " he was a good man , but god didn't save him , maybe god don't exist " .</p>
                        <p>another man answered him " no , god gave him many chances to save his life when everyone offered to take him to safety but he refused , thinking that god would save him in magical way , he was blinded by his own faith and wisdom ."</p>
                        <p>so here I am thinking , all these communities ,  I formed good friendships , these might have been my chances for having really good friends , and me leaving is just refusing what I've been giving and now maybe im just being punished for refusing it .</p>
                        <p>maybe im blinded by thinking I can be anyone's friend , maybe im just a fool after all .</p>
                        <p>should I try to go back to the old friendships that I formed and then just ended at one point , well that is no longer my choice , they probably forgot that I existed in the first place .</p>
                        <p>who knows where to go from here .</p>
                        <p>only time well tell .</p>
