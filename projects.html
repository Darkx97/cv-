                    <h2>chrome dinosaur game</h2>
                    <p>We all at somepoint lost internet connection and we're blessed with hours of - well maybe minuts - of palying the dinosaur game if you're using chrome, decided welp this game seems simple maybe i should make it some day ,2 years latter i started getting intrested in programing and i met java , wasnt fun in the begining but i was able to make it , it toke me about 3 days and its pecfect , but its ugly so maybe i'll come back to it latter and fix that issue .  </p>

                    <h2>S-DES encrpytion system</h2>
                    <p>This project is a disaster , the coding is allover the place , its not clean , its not easy to look at , the only reason i made it is cuz the proffessor told me to do it and i wasnt doing good in the subject at that time , I wasnt intrrested in encrypting , I'm still not intrested but the thing worked in the end it took me 3 hours to made , and even tho i chould have soulved the "text without spaces" issue but when I finished it I was done with it so I stoped there .</p>
