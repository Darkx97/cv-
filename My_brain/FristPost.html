                    <div><p>it might be late to document the early parts of my life at that time as there is a big window of error , but i believe its important as  it has a big part of what made me what i am right now .</p></div>

                    <div><h3>5 years old :</h3></div>
                    <div><p>A kid who's been left by his father in a " kindergarten" to start my interesting life as a student , i wasn't the braves kid , so when i saw my father leaving i started crying , as a kid i didn't understand , my father has to leave , i have to stay here , after a while i was used to that it was totally fine , i wasn't the smartest kid , i may have been one of the dumbest . </p>
                        <p>things that would embarrass other ppl to talk about is , the fact that i , didn't use the places bathrooms and tried to hold on until the end of the school day  wish wasn't successfully most the time . i had this problem haunting me for way longer than anyone should have it .</p>
                        <p>and i think i may have been dum compared to the other kids , witch maybe what started my hell during school life , being bullied and out numbered , and getting hit by the other kids in the school .</p>
                        <p>i was a small kid compared to the others witch can make you an ez target if you don't make friends , witch i didn't i also lacked the ability to socializes with the other kids , that made it much harder to socialize with  kids in next years to come , while having to deal with problems like bullies and being physically attacked most my days there .</p>
                        <p>at some point of my life maybe when i was 6 years old and in the 1st grade , my father bought  a computer , i was exited for simple reasons , games on the computer , witch i loved wasting my time on them more than anything else , made me forget about the hard time im having in school , feeling like an idiot , weak , out numbered , and dealing the fact that i still had trouble with using the bathrooms in the school , my excuse for most of that was that they were un clean , filled with spiders witch i still fear to this day , and even at this point i didn't really have a friend . it was just me the computer and the games.</p>

                    <div><p>its here where i made my first friend , who is my best friend to this day .</p>
                        <p>for the first time i feel like i can talk to someone , tell them anything without being hurt by them , i still had to deal with getting bullied and hurt from time to time but for me it was worth it to see that one person .</p>
                        <p>we fight sometimes but we still come back friends the next day this happens , felt like every time we fight our friendship is some what more than before .</p>

                    <div><p>im not at the same group as my friend but we still meat during break time in school , however im more outnumbered in my class , getting bullied more , and attacked more by more kids .</p>
                        <p>still i was able to forget about it when i see my friend , at that point we started to spend time outside of school together more , sometimes he invites me to his place , sometimes i invite him to mine we spent most our time playing games together . maybe just talking  about what ever our small brains can think.</p>

                    <div><p>me and my friend are in the same group again , but still the attacks becoming more frequent , i was learning a martial art ( karate ) to learn how to defend my self against the attacks it worked to some point un till i decided to quit , the attacks were more than i can bear , thanks to my friend i was safe from going insane .

                    <div><p>i got separated again from my friend into another group , and from this point on im always by my self in those groups , and of course the attacks are the same , and even increasing , my friend was able to form friendships from the other groups , but i wasn't , i was getting "smarter" how ever its the point where i started to get more interested in  math and science , my grade were mostly close to the top of my class , teachers were telling me that im smart , i don't think i was , i don't think i am now , but i believed them , and it helped me most the time to go through the tough times , the attacks were more violent , even if i ask for help from adults , its mostly useless , even when i fight back , im outnumbered.</p></div>

                    <div><p>im putting more time into trying to be a "smart" kid , and its working  when it came to math and science , but for the other subjects , there was no actual improvement , but that was enough for me to keep up with the hard time im having at school , and even tho i had my friend , and my little improvement on  studies , i was mostly sad , i have 1 younger brother and 2 older sisters , and for most the time by now , i think i was unwanted to participate with them , playing or just sitting together maybe even hated , i didn't hate them , i just didn't develop well as a kid , i couldn't play well with them , and as result left isolated , for most the time , we were able to get along by playing video games together sometimes but that didn't work for long enough , and i grow to avoid them most the time , but even then i couldn't hate them , at that point i was getting fat i was "comfort eating" maybe i couldn't just spend all the time with my friend and i already quit martial arts and my neighborhood wasn't the best place for me to try and play with the other kids there because most them where from my school , my class .</p>
                        <p>i saw one of the kids trying to hit my brother , i moved instantly hit the boy , he turned to fight me , and i lost . </p>
                        <p>but my brother was safe so that wat mattered , but i felt weak . </p>

                    <div><p>i moved into a bigger school , with more kids in it , most of them i had to try to fight daily defending my self , i was weak  though , i couldn't defend my self against every one .</p>
                        <p>im always hoping the my friend is not dealing with the same problems , he made a new friend , a kid that lives in the same neighborhood as me , one that i did fight once and lost after that fight i decided im not going outside , i'll stay in my home , i didn't think i can make more friends .</p>
                        <p>funny though how that kid who fought me once actually become one of my few friends .</p>
                        <p>out friendship didn't build up fast it was more of a slow one but he is still to this day one of my few friends .</p>
                        <p>however at that point i think i was told that i am a "smart kid "  too much now , stopped to study my grades went bad , and im not interested in math  and science anymore .</p>
                        <p>and im feeling more sad in general , more disappointed of my self , and started to feel like everyone around me is disappointed of me .</p>

                    <div><h3>17-18 highschool :</h3></div>
                    <div><p>i was still going through the hell i was still fighting it , but there is only so many fights you can fight , my grades were still getting worst , i wast getting worst as a person even to my friends , the only people that been nice to me during my school life , and at one point they  told me they wont talk to me anymore , because im unbearable  and rude to them , it was the one of the worst times of my life , but i needed it , i realized that i changed , i wasn't who used to be , i just became what i once hated , and  i had to change .</p>
                        <p>luckily for me my friends didn't totally give up on me , and after a while about 3 months .</p>
                        <p>they came to check on me , to tell me that they wont just give up on me and at least give me a chance to be a better person .</p>
                        <p>and i assume i became a little better than what i was before. </p>
                        <p>during that whole hellish school life tho , i was able to totally understand how the bullies work and how to deal with them , i no longer had to deal with that problem . </p>
                        <p>but i think it was too late , i think i was just slow to learn .</p>
                        <p>at that point i was more of a ... motionless person , if i hurt someone i don't feel bad or good about it , if i see someone in sadness i don't feel sad or happy about it .</p>
                        <p>i still had feelings when i was with my friends i just don't know how to describe for them how much i appreciate them , or if they're  going through tough times , how i show care to them .</p>
                        <p>i just stood there and smiled and told them , if you want to talk about anything , you can talk with me . </p>
                        <p>however for that time i felt like i was the last option for my friends , and it wast a pleasant feeling to have , but i still was happy to have them , and im someway understood that it would be reasonable based on my past .</p>
                        <p>during that time one of my friends father passed away , and i wanted to show my friend care but i couldn't , and felt bad about my self , i didn't know what should i do , and i did nothing .</p>
                        <p>thankfully i didn't end our friendship .</p>
                        <p>on that year too i failed for the first time and had to re do my highschool exams.</p>
                        <p>and on the next year the results came out and ... it was bad .</p>
                        <p>and at that point of time i was addicted to video games , and i was playing an (mmo) </p>
                        <p>online game where you can play and communicate with other players around the world, in my case i was only able to communicate with people from the middle east .</p>
                        <p>i was able to make friends in that game , i was able to make and somehow be a leader for a small community , it was my first experience with virtual reality .</p>
                        <p>how ever it was bad for me , i ended up being anti social , and incapable of communicating with other people in the real world.</p>
                        <p>but i was fixed on the idea that i hate everyone and i don't want to form more friendships with people other the ones i already made . </p>

                    <div><h3>19 years old the outside world : </h3></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>I traveled to another country to get an education degree , at that point i was interesting in computers and how they work , and i was mostly interested in programing .</p>
                        <p>i dealt with a lot of difficulties when i was there one of them was , the guy that i was staying with threatening me to kick me out of his place and making me sleep on the street , that made me find another person that can "house" me for a little while  until i got someplace for my self to stay with.</p>
                        <p>the fact that i had to learn the language that people speak over there .</p>
                        <p>And that i needed to learn another language "french" to be able to understand what im being taught in university, and i failed to learn it , other than another factor that i wasn't able to sign up with the university on time , so i started in the middle of the semester , and at that point i don't understand anything about math anymore , so that made me feel even more stupid  and i didn't have access to the internet.</p>
                        <p>it wasn't an easy time for me .</p>
                        <p>But i was able to sit with only my thoughts in my head , trying to learn who am i , and what do i want to do , and what do i want to be .</p>
                        <p>i was able to learn how to communicate with other people , even make friendships with them , most people were nice to me , and that made me think maybe i shouldn't hate all .</p>
                        <p>but i had to go back to my home , im wasting my time here .</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div><h3>20-22 years old the big sad : </h3></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>So i came back from my journey as a failure , but i was planing to go back little , only to change my mind in one week , but my father insisted that i learn french here and they go back to continue my education , and even tho he gave me the option , i felt pressured like i had no choice and i accepted that . </p>
                        <p>but i couldn't keep up , i just stopped attending the lessons ,i felt useless , the lesions were not cheap and i felt worthless , i cant do anything , i tried to look for a job for a while and i couldn't find any , and the feeling of being useless started to haunt me , all the time . </p>
                        <p>i was un able to keep on learning how to program , its like my brain has shutdown it self , and can only do one thing , think about how useless and un worthy  i am . </p>
                        <p>and that idea made me unable to focus or even start to work on something that im passionate about , something that i used to be able to do even in a bad mode , i was no longer able to do .</p>
                        <p>all i was able to do is just lay on bed in my room , thinking about the bad things all the time , blaming others for my misery .</p>
                        <p>hating everything around me even more . and i tried to push my friends away from me , i wished  never existed in the first place , and it would be better for everyone if i didn't exist .</p>
                        <p>only focused on my mistakes that i made since i was a kid , i though that i was really bad kid and that resulted into what i am now , the worst enemy that i had all that time was just me .</p>
                        <p>and then anxieties started to attack me all the time , am i even worth it , should i event try , clearly i'll fail again .</p>
                        <p>until one day i was just walking outside , because my home was becoming hell for me , and met 2 of my friends and just tried to run away , at that point i made fights with 2 of them to get them to ignore me , and make it as if our friendship has ended .</p>
                        <p>one of them was not aware of what's going on , and while the other  just kept walking away , he kept yelling my name and telling me to stopped , and asked me whats up ,and i tried to tell him , that i think im worthless and useless and maybe should kill my self , and that was one of my friends that at the time  i though he still don't like me and he might not give too much care to what im going thro and will to give up on me quickly .</p>
                        <p>he told me that im decently more than this , we talked for a while and , he asked me , what do i want to be , and if i know if thats what i really want to be  and if i know the road to be what i want to be .</p>
                        <p>and i was almost crying at that point and i told him what i wanted to be and that i know how to do it but for some reason im unable to do what i want to do , and constantly having these bad ideas about me being a worthless and useless person and i would never be anything .</p>
                        <p>he told me that i need sometime to think positively  about everything .</p>
                        <p>i was still feeling bad at that point but i was happy that my friend cared to what im going through , it was a great time , and i realized that i had a good friend .</p>
                        <p>at that point i was wasting my time , washing "youtube" videos , mostly about learning how to program and about  psychology , and i discover the man by the name " jordan peterson" and for me he explained what im going through and ways that i can use to at least trick my brain into stopping to think that im useless .</p>
                        <p>and by that time i learned how to accept ppl with other believes , how to manage thinking , how to respect other people's opinions , how to forgive everyone who's been bad to me , and how to argue with other people , and started to be intrusted in how other people think , i wanted to know more about how people become what they are and why , however i was still facing problems with going back to my passion "programing".</p>
                        <p>I decided to get my education in my home country and signed up for a collage that accepts someone with a bad degree  like , and i met some interesting people there , but no one that i can consider a friend , but i was able to gain everyone's respect .</p>

                    <div><h3>23 years old the journey begins : </h3></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>I'm at the last semester of my 2 year collage , and i was still somewhat depressed.</p>
                        <p>but i remembered the simple tasks that i can give my self to improve my mental health , and after a while i noticed some improvement and decided im going to start actually learning programing again , so i started making simple projects as small challenges to see if im capable of doing what i like to do , and while i was doing that i decided to try a game or rather a community , that game was called VR chat .</p>
                        <p>when i joined i was looking for friends from deferent cultures , deferent places of the world , and it wasn't an easy task , most people in that game would not actually talk , but i've been there i tried to talk to people telling them its safe to talk and its going to help them to talk about whats bothering them if they are going through tough times , maybe not me but someone they can trust , and i was lucky enough to talk to some of them , and ended finding interesting people over there , people that i felt somewhat like they been in a similar experience to what i had in my school life , we made really good friends at some point we even opened about whats bothering us how we are feeling like we are weak , or we don't have place in this world or that we don't know what are we doing with out lives.</p>
                        <p>we listened to each other on the hard times , i felt bad for then when they were going through depression , it was like me looking at my past self in a way , and like my friends help me when i needed them , i  decided im going to help these people as much as i can , i almost broke into tears looking at one of them going to what felt very similar to what i've been though , the main though in my head was , these people where nice enough to listen to me and talk to me , i can just leave to whatever hell they are going through  but at the same time i felt weak , i can do to them is talking , thankfully they improved after just talking that made me happy .</p>
                        <p>at some point depression came back to haunting me again , and while i usually ask for my friends in the "real world" for help , i was trying to hold my self together by my self , it was a bad idea , and while i was talking to my friends i found my self about to break in tears , feeling really sad for not being able to work on my passion again from the depressed i told them that i had to leave , and i did i just slept on that , the next day though , they asked me what happened and if i want to talk about it , in my head there was the idea " maybe you cant trust them " but that same idea truck another " why would you want people to trust you if you don't want to trust them , that doesn't seem fare for them and it might build hate in your self for other people again  "  so  i decided to talk about it with them , and they were just listening and trying to help me go though it , they were caring and kind , i guess sometimes all i need  is just to talk about what bothers me , maybe everyone dose , however that idea of me seeking trust from others and not giving it back kept flowing in my head  and decided i need to change my self .</p>
                        <p>after a while , i decided that im going to leave that group of friends until for sometime , they asked me to stay when they did i almost broke into tears , they asked me why im leaving i couldn't give them a good answer other than " i think i need to distance my self for a little while , and improve my self as person  , well you ever welcome me back if i came back ? " they replied "yes" , im glad they understood my decision , but i always wonder if that was a good decision , i think that it might be the wrong one , it still have impact on me that i left that group and i still want to go back to them as soon as i can , even though i know that things must have changed .</p>
                        <p>i told this story to one of my friends and they said  " i don't think you should isolate your self , maybe you should go back to that group " , some day i will.</p>
                        
                        <p>And then i started making a website all about who am i and my journey of learning how to program and maybe my journey to make more friends and changing my self to what i think is the best .</p>
                        
                        <p>And after a while i made another friend , an interesting person that had somewhat similar personality to my old friends but a bit deferent , we started talk about what we usually think and what things we are inserted in there was a lot of similarities , the first conversation was all over the place , but it was a good beginning , i ended up looking forward for the next time we talk about what ever floating in our heads , we talked about our cultures , how we think , how we believe people around us think , what things we see wrong with the societies around us and how we feel somewhat deferent from the people around us.</p>
                        <p>I like to think that we both found each other interesting , and were happy to exchange information about out societies and personalities , for me it was a great person that i met by a chance , who i would never had chance to meat in real life giving the fact that he is on the other side of the planet for me , and i wanted to trust that person but i didn't have good way to judge if i can really trust that person or not , and it wasn't that i think bad about them  its just hard  for someone like my self going through what i've been though  to just trust someone so easily .</p>
                        <p>And the "test" came by it self , i was already feeling down for a while when it happened , it was like depression and anxiety are coming back to haunt me again , and i've been having hard time to work on my projects , it was a time where i was doubting my ability to form more friendships and i just didn't have much luck while also not being able to work on my projects , and then my friend joined me and he asked me " whats up ?" , thats when decided that i cant just keep in distancing people away from me all the time , and givin that i felt that he is an understanding person , i started talking about problems i think im having and maybe something is wrong with me , i decided to take the risk and talk to someone who i still that that time considered a stranger , soon enough another one of my friends who i considered stranger join us , and saw us talking he said hello and started to engage with our conversation , i also had some doubts about them but it turned out that both of them were great people , and the result was that he did listen to me and tried to help me move on though it , telling me that "nothing is wrong with feeling sad sometimes" i already knew that , but it feels like i never accepted it , maybe its just hard to keep on moving along that path alone , i started crying while talking as i was un able to describe the mixed feelings of being lost , while also being happy at the same time for having someone that cares about my well being .</p>
                        <p>on that day i knew that i made my self tow new friends .</p>
                        
                        <p>I already was in a community at that time ,  a one that decided its time for me to leave , it wasn't the first time that i do this in a community , join in make friends and leave to develop your self and find another community , however this time it hade some impact on me , in that community i explained for the people what i've been going through and that everything is fine after dealing with it , i also explained why i leave  with a "goodbye" message to everyone in that community , it wasn't the best but it was good ppl cared just in a deferent way .</p>
                        <p>When i left i decided to personally say goodbye to everyone , and then i met one person who is at that time 16-17 years old , and as i was saying "we might not see each other ever again" , they were kind enough to say "take care and don't lose your self " , and then that idea struck my head " i've always been  sad for being excluded and ignored or just  left alone , am i doing the same thing that been done to me to this person , have i became what i once hated " , i might have , what i know is that i need to find that person again and apologies for them for what i have done , this gonna have to wait for a while though .</p>
                        <p>it made me sad again and i had to talk about with a friend just to check if im going insane , or maybe im doing something bad to these people that leave.</p>
                        
                        <p>between this i met some interesting people but unfortunately our friendship didn't work because of some complicated situation , so for now im still looking for a community</p>
                        
                        <p>I think i did taste some of my poison though.</p>
                        
                        <p>after a little while i started to look for another people to friend , and i met one person that was , nice  and interesting to me , they were from a culture that i don't have much access to even in the virtual world. and at some point i started talking about things that i have problem with in this game and how i feel it relates to problems that i have in real life , and some of the things that i've gone through , and they started to share their own experience as well they tried to help me not feel bad about what im going through good things are going to eventually happen until at some point  i disconnected from the virtual world , and i was unable to find that person again , maybe thats how it feels when i leave those places , maybe thats an alarm fro me to tell me "those people you left might have the same feelings that your having right now about not being able to find that person again" , and then the same idea start floating in my head again "have i become what i once hated?"</p>
                        
                        <p>and i talked to my new friend about it , he told me  "thats probably your brain trying to tell you something your not paying attention to , not necessarily that your becoming what you once hated but that still might be the case , maybe you should stop doing this and just stay in the communities that you find comfortable being at ", and then told him that i cant get it out of my brain , they he asked me " do you write ? " i said no , he replied " maybe you should , documenting you thoughts might help finding a solution" , and i thought about it and decided im going to try .</p>
                        
                        <p>and thats where this document started .</p>
